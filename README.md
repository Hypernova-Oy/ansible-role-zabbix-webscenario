# ansible-role-zabbix-webscenario

Ansible role which creates or deletes (NO UPDATE) zabbix web scenarios
For each entry in the 'websites' variable with state: present, this role will :

* Add a web scenario
* Add a basic step
* Add a trigger associated to that web scenario

For each entry in the 'websites' variable with state: absent, this role will :
* Delete the web scenario associated to its name
* Delete the trigger associated to it

For any update of an existing web scenario, it must first be deleted (manually or by changing its state to absent, executing the playbook, then changing it back to 'present')

          hostid: 10084                                       #hostid of the sourcehost from where the web scenarios will be executed (must be already created)

          interval: 30                                        #default interval of execution of the web scenarios
          retries: 5                                          #default maximum number of retries

      websites:
          ## Creates a webscenario with two steps (one for http and one for https)
          ##Â First step checks http://mycompany.com using GET HTTP method, expects 200,301 or 302 as return code, expects string 'Welcome to mycompany website'
          ## Second step checks https://mycompany.com using GET HTTP method, expects 200,301 or 302 as return code, expects string 'Welcome to mycompany website'
          ## The associated trigger will have two tags, display and any_other_tag.
        - name: 'Our Company Website'                         #name of the web scenario
          url: 'mycompany.com'                                #url of the web scenario (DO NOT PUT http(s)://)
          state: present                                      #state, present or absent
          https: 'yes'                                        #is the website in https ? no by default
          method: 'GET'                                       #http method used, GET or HEAD, HEAD by default
          status_codes: '200,301,302'                         #expected http code returned, 200 by default
          expected: 'Welcome to mycompany website'            #expected string on the page, method MUST be GET for this to work
          trigger_tags:                                       #tags to add with the associated trigger
            display: 'yes'
            any_other_tag: 'any_value'

          ## Creates a webscenario with one step, checking http://anotherwebsite.com/ using HEAD HTTP method, expects 200 as return code
        - name: 'Another website'
          url: 'anotherwebsite.com'
          state: present
