# ansible-role-zabbix-webscenario

Ansible role which creates or deletes (NO UPDATE) zabbix web scenarios
For each entry in the 'z_websites' variable with state: present, this role will :

* Add a web scenario
* Add a basic step
* Add a trigger associated to that web scenario

For each entry in the 'z_websites' variable with state: absent, this role will :
* Delete the web scenario associated to its name
* Delete the trigger associated to it

For any update of an existing web scenario, it must first be deleted (manually or by changing its state to absent, executing the playbook, then changing it back to 'present')
